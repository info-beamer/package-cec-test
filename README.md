# Description

info-beamer OS now captures CEC inputs. This allows you to use the remote
control of your connected HDMI screen. Commands are forwarded into the
running Lua code and can be handled there.

You can build interactive interfaces that way. This code shows the bare
minimum code for interfacing with CEC.
